        <p>A basic general principle is that unless mankind learns from history, it will repeat itself. We live in today’s world, and our ancestors faced the same problems as their ancestors and experienced the same effects on them. It is puzzling and implausible that today’s world continues to struggle with issues of race and racism that are embedded in people’s minds. Cases of murder, theft, unemployment, police brutality and illiteracy are inextricably linked to racism and racial injustice. Thankfully, activists and authors among others, not only seek to the issue but also through their contribution, to shed light on racial issues. This will help the society gain an informed understanding of what it is dealing with. Additionally, these materials are intended to give different perspective from polar sides to show how the other person thinks of the same issue. Essentially, through their writings they try and act as a middle ground and would be seen through the analysis of various articles in the essay</p>
<p>Most articles on issues such as racism are written in the first person. This can be done by telling a personal story or an event that happened to someone close to the author. Therefore, it is easy for the author to resonate with their hearts, thus directly affecting their emotions. For example , James Baldwin’s letter begins with an emotional plot where he torn the letter five times because of how hard and painful it was to write the letter in the first place (Genius, 2020). He confesses how does the pain that comes with it shape his views. In addition, James shows how the chains of racism have had a serious and depressing effect on past and future generations. Moreover, in the letter, he explicitly explained to his nephew the expectations of the society around him, since he had grown up under similar conditions in a society that was classified by skin color and race. He argues that the ignorance of the pertinent issue has destroyed and continues to destroy ‘hundreds and thousands of lives’ (Genius, 2020) without knowing it and neglecting it altogether. Further, James goes on to paint the picture of white supremacy as being the ‘innocence’ responsible for the racial crimes. This is because they actively let racial prejudice become the status quo in the place where he was born, including his peers, including his nephews. However, James is hopeful that with love the innocents would be compelled to see themselves as they are and stop denying their reality, but instead, begin to change them (Genius, 2020).  The letter to my nephew is a great literary work because James has written with the perspective through his brother his fellow countrymen and finally through his nephew.</p>
<p>“I have a Dream” is one of the most memorable speeches in the world, especially because it emphasizes hope. Martin Luther King repeated the words “I have a dream” more than eight times in consecutive sentences. As a result, he became one of the most enduring figures in history, giving new wings to hope at a time of turmoil when racism was ravaging America. Luther was a voice and a beacon of hope against the backdrop of historical racism that had crippled the Negro community as he would say (American Rhetoric, 2020). He declared, bigoted ideologies and beliefs that stratify societies and nations would be abandoned in favor of principles that promoted brotherhood. He stressed that the people should not accept the idea of division, but should instead return to their respective countries and move forward regardless of the present situation. Here the crowd applauds as Luther goes on to state examples of cities and states like Mississippi (American Rhetoric, 2020) that he anticipates would be transformed as a result of hope for the future. Moreover, throughout the speech, Martin Luther King Junior uses relevant examples that resonate with the crowds For instance, he uses the example of the ‘slums and ghettos of the northern cities’ in order to excite emotions for his audience. Additionally, Luther uses various of metaphorical language, unalienable rights of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness (American Rhetoric, 2020) so that the listening crowd would understand and grasp the importance of having citizenship rights. </p>
<p>In his article On Black in China, Marketus Presswood describes his experiences in China with specific examples that highlight the racist plight of a black person in China. After tutoring Chinese students in English for a while, the author suddenly noticed a strange reaction in his class. After the investigation, the supervisor was disappointed to admit to him that the reason for these reactions was his skin color (Presswood, 2013). Thus, this event elicits an empathic response because it is narrated by the individual himself. Through this development, it is necessary for us to conclude that there exists a distorted view of people, especially people of color. In addition, the author amplifies this ethnic construction through another example of a Chinese cosmetics industry based on stereotypes. For example, as mentioned in the article, “whiteness” is the most desirable characteristic of women, so it is inevitable that stores selling beauty products will have more creams (Presswood, 2013). In addition,  the model advertisements that qualify to fit and fill billboards and other mediums are all of one standard of beauty. Just like Martin Luther King Juniors’ speech, examples serve to paint to the audience a picture which sheds more light to the issue thus giving it more consideration. In addition, the author of the article reveals the issue of race in the context of historical narration. For example, he goes back to the 20th century, when color was just a pigment in someone’s skin, and that didn’t prevent a productive collaboration between Black Americans and Chinese intellectuals. In addition, historical evidence is more practical and illustrative because it touches on Chinese history and, therefore, dissolves existing beliefs that later emerged in their culture. Finally, another example the author uses is sports, especially the NBA. As mentioned in the article, at least 78% of NBA players are black (Presswood, 2019). An estimated 300 million people play basketball in China, forcing people to reconsider their stereotypes. On Black in China used some resonant examples to effectively communicate the issue of race.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the above analysis of the three articles has served to show how different authors influence people through drawing empathy in various ways. Thus, racial and racial injustice have been depicted as ills in the society and their consequences highlighted both on personal levels and general levels. Moreover, regardless of the disappointing and disheartening reality, the articles through their different constitution have also evoked hope through using various metaphors and emphatic terms just like Martin Luther King Junior preached.   </p>
