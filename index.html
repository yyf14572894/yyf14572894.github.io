            <p>As you continue reading (and perhaps listening to the speech), pay attention to the figures of speech used by King to depict states of oppression like slavery and states of freedom. Write down at least 3 such literary devices here, with a short explanation of what they symbolize/mean. Pay especially to the way in which metaphors or light, fire, heat, and water, coolness are used in relation to justice and injustice:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Parallelism ( In paragraph 6, MLK use Now is the time……….Now is the time…..Now is the time to show the importance of the freedon, democracy and qualty.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2.metaphor( MLK use great beacon light to metaphor the Emancipation proclamation in the beginning of the text, and flames of withering injustice means<br>Negro slaves who had been seared. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>repeat /.（ we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.）MLK use together several time in same paragraph to let all of the the negro to know that they will fight together for the same goal. </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>MLK speaks of America as having given its Black citizens a “bad check.” A bad check is a check one writes to cover a payment for which there are no funds. What does he mean by a “bad check” here?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The bad check means that The negro was not endowed with the rights of life, freedom and pursuit of happiness</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where does the audience’s reaction show that MLK’s speech is especially effective? Where do you hear applause? Pause in one of such moments and try to analyze what in MLK’s speech the audience is reacting to. Which words seem to strike a chord (create an emotion in the crowd listening to the speech). Write down the line that caused this emotion, and write 3-4 sentences of analysis why it was effective. What emotion, do you think, do people have at that moment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Martin Luther King’s speech is characterized by its ability to combine personal views, audience emotions and language. His speech is skillful in language and skillful in rhetoric. In addition, his ability to mobilize the atmosphere of the scene is great. In his speech, there is a kind of magic power that directly points to the people’s heart, which often makes the crowd excited</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How does the speech work as a speech of persuading, motivating, and moving people to action? What role does empathy play in this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>he success of MLK’s speech is because at that time was largely in line with the historical background that negros were oppressed by racial discrimination and urgently needed to be understand and treated fairly </p>

            <p>A basic general principle is that unless mankind learns from history, it will repeat itself. We live in today’s world, and our ancestors faced the same problems as their ancestors and experienced the same effects on them. It is puzzling and implausible that today’s world continues to struggle with issues of race and racism that are embedded in people’s minds. Cases of murder, theft, unemployment, police brutality and illiteracy are inextricably linked to racism and racial injustice. Thankfully, activists and authors among others, not only seek to the issue but also through their contribution, to shed light on racial issues. This will help the society gain an informed understanding of what it is dealing with. Additionally, these materials are intended to give different perspective from polar sides to show how the other person thinks of the same issue. Essentially, through their writings they try and act as a middle ground and would be seen through the analysis of various articles in the essay</p>
<p>Most articles on issues such as racism are written in the first person. This can be done by telling a personal story or an event that happened to someone close to the author. Therefore, it is easy for the author to resonate with their hearts, thus directly affecting their emotions. For example , James Baldwin’s letter begins with an emotional plot where he torn the letter five times because of how hard and painful it was to write the letter in the first place (Genius, 2020). He confesses how does the pain that comes with it shape his views. In addition, James shows how the chains of racism have had a serious and depressing effect on past and future generations. Moreover, in the letter, he explicitly explained to his nephew the expectations of the society around him, since he had grown up under similar conditions in a society that was classified by skin color and race. He argues that the ignorance of the pertinent issue has destroyed and continues to destroy ‘hundreds and thousands of lives’ (Genius, 2020) without knowing it and neglecting it altogether. Further, James goes on to paint the picture of white supremacy as being the ‘innocence’ responsible for the racial crimes. This is because they actively let racial prejudice become the status quo in the place where he was born, including his peers, including his nephews. However, James is hopeful that with love the innocents would be compelled to see themselves as they are and stop denying their reality, but instead, begin to change them (Genius, 2020).  The letter to my nephew is a great literary work because James has written with the perspective through his brother his fellow countrymen and finally through his nephew.</p>
<p>“I have a Dream” is one of the most memorable speeches in the world, especially because it emphasizes hope. Martin Luther King repeated the words “I have a dream” more than eight times in consecutive sentences. As a result, he became one of the most enduring figures in history, giving new wings to hope at a time of turmoil when racism was ravaging America. Luther was a voice and a beacon of hope against the backdrop of historical racism that had crippled the Negro community as he would say (American Rhetoric, 2020). He declared, bigoted ideologies and beliefs that stratify societies and nations would be abandoned in favor of principles that promoted brotherhood. He stressed that the people should not accept the idea of division, but should instead return to their respective countries and move forward regardless of the present situation. Here the crowd applauds as Luther goes on to state examples of cities and states like Mississippi (American Rhetoric, 2020) that he anticipates would be transformed as a result of hope for the future. Moreover, throughout the speech, Martin Luther King Junior uses relevant examples that resonate with the crowds For instance, he uses the example of the ‘slums and ghettos of the northern cities’ in order to excite emotions for his audience. Additionally, Luther uses various of metaphorical language, unalienable rights of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness (American Rhetoric, 2020) so that the listening crowd would understand and grasp the importance of having citizenship rights. </p>
<p>In his article On Black in China, Marketus Presswood describes his experiences in China with specific examples that highlight the racist plight of a black person in China. After tutoring Chinese students in English for a while, the author suddenly noticed a strange reaction in his class. After the investigation, the supervisor was disappointed to admit to him that the reason for these reactions was his skin color (Presswood, 2013). Thus, this event elicits an empathic response because it is narrated by the individual himself. Through this development, it is necessary for us to conclude that there exists a distorted view of people, especially people of color. In addition, the author amplifies this ethnic construction through another example of a Chinese cosmetics industry based on stereotypes. For example, as mentioned in the article, “whiteness” is the most desirable characteristic of women, so it is inevitable that stores selling beauty products will have more creams (Presswood, 2013). In addition,  the model advertisements that qualify to fit and fill billboards and other mediums are all of one standard of beauty. Just like Martin Luther King Juniors’ speech, examples serve to paint to the audience a picture which sheds more light to the issue thus giving it more consideration. In addition, the author of the article reveals the issue of race in the context of historical narration. For example, he goes back to the 20th century, when color was just a pigment in someone’s skin, and that didn’t prevent a productive collaboration between Black Americans and Chinese intellectuals. In addition, historical evidence is more practical and illustrative because it touches on Chinese history and, therefore, dissolves existing beliefs that later emerged in their culture. Finally, another example the author uses is sports, especially the NBA. As mentioned in the article, at least 78% of NBA players are black (Presswood, 2019). An estimated 300 million people play basketball in China, forcing people to reconsider their stereotypes. On Black in China used some resonant examples to effectively communicate the issue of race.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the above analysis of the three articles has served to show how different authors influence people through drawing empathy in various ways. Thus, racial and racial injustice have been depicted as ills in the society and their consequences highlighted both on personal levels and general levels. Moreover, regardless of the disappointing and disheartening reality, the articles through their different constitution have also evoked hope through using various metaphors and emphatic terms just like Martin Luther King Junior preached.   </p>

            <p> My interest is photography, it is not qualifies to describe myself as a photographer because my shooting skills still need to prove. But photograph bring to me a lot of encourage and thinking to my life. </p>
<p>Just as any boy loves digital products, I was curious about the camera. I ask my mom whole month for buying a camera. She still being apathetic and refused me by saying this: “ What’s the use of buying this? Would it help your life a lot? Do you think you could be a professional photographer? ” A series of rhetorical question crushed my dream. It is similar to the comic which created by Gene lean Yang. “ But my ma-ma says that’s silly. Little boys don’t  grow up to be transformers” </p>
<p>My username used to be City, because I feel I live in a cage for long time. Want to have a trip, But don’t know where to go.  And my mother was pregnant with my little brother when I was in primary school, so for the next several years, I got no opportunities to have a trip with my family. And they never let me go somewhere far from home because they think I was too young. The turning point, however, came during a summer vacation in 2014. I participate a summer school at New Zealand and shooting various of photos in my WeChat moments by phone. I was surprised how many people gave me thumb up and comments. Later, I start consider that I should learning photography to record my life. </p>
<p>The first thing I start with is viewing photos on 500px, lofter, and Flickr which are the famous photography websites. And watching shooting skills on Youtube and Bilibili. I thought I would learn painting, piano, guitar, English and so on just like before, and then I would never touch them again. But this time it was different: photography was an interest with quick feedback. Whether it’s taking a satisfying photo to make yourself feel better, or taking an interesting photo to put together in the Moment.Constant positive feedback gives me the motivation to make progress.<br>I sold my guitar( Headway, a handmade guitar from Japan) and try to buy a camera.<br>Film photography and its unique aesthetics first captured my attention. But I got a Sony digital camera because I’m a straightforward person - I much prefer the simple process of plugging my camera to my laptop and have photos available on the screen 10 seconds later, than wait for films to develop slowly.</p>
<p> I made a plan to practice shooting to cultivate my photographic eye. Gradually, people in the Moment felt that the level of photos I took had improved, and even someone asked me to take some photos. For example: take a one-inch picture, take a picture of an activity arranged by the school and so on. This gave me a sudden break to get out of “city” once in a while.</p>
<p>Further more, I got a lot of friends who love photography and usually hang out with them in order to find some special position and shooting fabulous photo. Actually, they help me understand more about photography and life. I have a friend, who appreciates street photography as much as me, but shoots strictly film. One day, we went shooting together. He would go back and forth before capturing “the decisive moment”. He immerses himself by walking into the scene and getting closer to the target. The technical limitation of shooting film requires him to slow down and think. In comparison, I shoot like a robot - overly rely on focal length and press the shutter non stop. Even though I continue to shoot digital as I lack technical skills, I tried shooting like my friend. It felt awkward at first. I had to constantly fight through bad habits. For a few weeks, I set rules such as no focal length adjustment and a maximum of 3 snaps for each scene. Gradually, I became less rushed and spent more time interacting with the environment. At the same time, being able to see the shots helped me improve a lot faster. It keeps me doing the same things in life. For example, before starting a new thing. I would thinking specifically, making a list, and setting several alarm clock to remind myself. </p>
<p>With continuous improvement, now I am a group member of Rutger photography club. Last semester, we will have the meeting and activities to shooting outside.Photography opened the door for me and made me realize that I could do it. No matter what happen, always thinking that I still have photography. So now I turned it into 365 cities, and I wanted to see more and do more. Photography has really changed my life in a way That I never realized I could be where I am today. Thanks for the photography.</p>

            <p>This semester is coming to the end.<br>Due to the covid-19,I have to take online classes, and upside down the day and night at home. It’s really unhealthy to get up at 4 am every morning to attend class, but thanks to EAD II is a asynchronous course.</p>
<p>In this class, I learned many interesting topics about racial problem. I think I know it very well because the professor has provided us with many articles on these subjects. I don’t think my understanding of issue of that has changed. Just as I think, racial discrimination is very close to us. No matter in any country, even in China, which is composed of the majority of the Han people, there will still be all kinds of discrimination. But people all over the world should develop harmoniously and freely. </p>
<p>What impresses me most is project 1, because it makes me understand myself deeply. In the past I used to read and write about others, but rarely think deeply about myself. Project 4, which is what I’m doing now， let me learn how to build a website from scratch. Because of personal things, I doing all assignment behind others, my professor asked me to just simply build a website. But I thought about it seriously, I decided to make a big decision, not just for submit a assignment but to build a website of my own with my own domain name. In the future, I want to put some of my photography works on my blog.</p>
<p>As a student who take English as secondary language. It is inevitable to write wrong grammar in every assignment. In this case, the feedback of professor would be a excellent approach to improve my writting. Because we need to revise every project. Learn during the revision to avoid the same mistake happen in future.</p>
<p>For Ead II, we need to explore our own idea and contrast with the article. Personally speaking, It does reduce the numbers of words, but limited my thinking. For many times I got inspiration but have no connection with aeticle, so I have to throw it away. </p>
<p>Project 2 must be my challenge, because it take me long time to read the article, and I even don’t understand for some paragraph. </p>
<p>I have to admit that I did not make my whole effort into this course, I am sorry to my professor. There are so many assignment that I didn’t submit. For a long time I was out of spirits because encountered a very terrible thing a month ago. And also I didn’t do a specific plan for my study this semester. I need to make a list for everything in the next semester, and do the assignment as earlier as possible instead of waiting to the end day of deadline. </p>

            <p>With the Case of Floyd, the issue of racism was again brought to the attention of the audience,The goal of human beings is to eliminate discrimination and strive for more living space for each member of human civilization. Racial discrimination is undoubtedly one of the most serious setbacks. Instead of China, where consist of mostly of Han Chinese. America is a truly multi-ethnic country were can found every ethnic people in there. In this case , people might consider that racial discrimination happen seriously in America but ignore the fact that China, a seemingly harmonious country, is full of racial discrimination. Chinese people not only existing subconsciously discriminate against others, having stereotype about black people, but also look down each other between mainland and HongKong. </p>
<p>We have to admit that racial discrimination exist in china and happen usually even various people did not realize it. Psychology divides discrimination into explicit discrimination and implicit discrimination. Explicit discrimination refers to the external and obvious verbal and physical attacks on people through racial factors. Thanks to the predecessors in the affirmative action movement, racial equality has long been the absolute political correctness. Explicit discrimination in Western countries, as long as the evidence is conclusive, can be appealed to the legal justice. In China, there exist serious of Explicit discrimination. For example, when a person from the North went to a convenience store in Shanghai to buy food, clerk greeted him in dialect, but he could not understand, and some clerks discriminated against him. This has appeared in the news for many times. In the 3.29,2020, A news was trending on Weibo which is talk about about a shopping assistant who swear at man because he couldn’t understand Shanghainese. Some netizens revealed that, in a FamilyMart in Shanghai, just because the man who didn’t understand Shanghai dialect, and ask him to speak mandarin.This could be connect with the article “cause of prejudice” which written by Vincent Parrillo “An action-orientation level of prejudice is the positive or negative predisposition to engage in discriminatory behavior. A person who harbors strong feelings about members of a certain racial or ethnic group may have a tendency to act for or against them—being aggressive or nonaggressive, offering assistance or withholding it.” As we can see, that clerk harbors strong feeling about Shanghai people is supreme and better than other place. So he has a great contempt for outsiders. Another one is implicit discrimination. It is similar to the “For some people, prejudice may indeed be rooted in subconscious”. Prejudice based on race, skin color, national origin, etc. Even after a massive rational crackdown, Chinese still unconsciously make subconsciously biased choices. Let’s say you stop two cabs on the street in North America, one Asian and one black, and you subconsciously pick the Asian driver. This is because the stereotype of black people in your mind makes you make a subconscious choice. You unconsciously fear and protect yourself, and you unwittingly become a “racist” in the eyes of the black driver.</p>
<p>The discrimination against blacks is even more serious. One of the strangest things I’ve heard is that an English training center in Shanghai is recruiting foreign teachers for oral English. The job Posting says that white people from Europe and the United States are preferred, followed by white people non-English-speaking countries. So perhaps a brutish-born, well-educated, english-standard black man would not be able to get such a job simply because of the color of his skin.This paragraph could connect with the Marketus Presswood’s article, “On Being Black in China”. “While on break, I overheard students speaking in Chinese about how they were paying so much money and wanted a white instructor. One student went so far as to say, “I don’t want to look at his black face all night.””An black person being an English tutor to Chinese students for a while, the author suddenly begins to notice strange reactions in his class. Upon investigations, the supervisor disappointedly admits to him that the reasons for the reactions was because of his color. The reason of discrimination against black people in China is largely derived from “fear”. The general impression of black people in China is “black, low level of education, low IQ, violence, disorderly life”, etc., all of which are negative impressions like backward primitive human beings. There are many strange phenomena, such as taxi drivers afraid to pick up black passengers, restaurants unwilling to serve black meals, parents unwilling to let their children touch black people and so on. It is true that illegal African immigrants in some cities along the southeast coast are disturbing the social order, but they are also partly to blame for the negative media coverage of them. Further,There was an advertisement of washing machine in China. Specifically, a black man saw a girl washing clothed by washing machine and wanted to greet her. However, the girl threw the black man into the washing machine. A few minutes later there was a white man coming out of the washing machine. This advertisement has caused great controversy in the United States. Eventually the company withdrew this advertisement and apologized to the public.</p>
<p>The third one is the discrimination between Hong Kong people and mainland people. As a special administrative region of China, Hong Kong is different from the mainland in both culture and People’s Daily life style, and even its laws are completely different.Hong Kong people generally hold the view that the mainland people are of low quality, occupying the social resources of Hong Kong and affecting the normal life of Hong Kong people. The common view of Hong Kong people in mainland China is that they look down on mainland tourists and treat foreigners with respect, they are flunkey.It can be seen that some Hong Kong people have biased views on mainlanders. On the one hand, the uncivilized behavior of some mainland tourists leaves a bad impression on Hong Kong people.On the other hand, it is also because Hong Kong people do not have an objective and fair evaluation of the mainland. Some Hong Kong people may have been to various countries in the world, but have never been to the mainland. In order to refused mainland people stay in HongKong, many of Hong Kong people group together and destroy and demonstration, according to the news of china.com, “ when a large number of fully armed “black masked party” marched to Tsim Sha Tsui, some people went to the hardware store to buy equipment and demolish iron bars along the way. In the evening, the rioters divided into three routes. They set off a series of violent attacks in Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok and Wong Tai Sin police stations. They destroyed, set fire to and blocked road traffic. They also blocked the Cross Harbour Tunnel in Hung Hom twice in an attempt to create a large-scale riot”. As we can see, Many Hong Kong people still have prejudice against the mainland people. They are extremely reluctant mainland people stay in any corner of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Furthermore,  those Hong Kong people who really discriminate against mainland Chinese are not only mostly non-native Hong Kong people, but also are mainland immigrants.For example, Luqiu Luwei, a famous journalist who grew up in the mainland and gained Hong Kong status after marrying a Hong Kong citizen, is famous for her unprincipled attacks on China and praises for the West, to the point of double standards and anti-intelligence.She has written that New Yorkers run red lights as a flexible use of the rules while “Chinese crossing” is unprincipled recklessness “Crossing the street in New York City, if not carefully observed, will be simply commented as “Chinese style crossing the road”, because you can see at any time and place that New Yorkers will not stand there obediently and wait for the pedestrian green light to go through the zebra crossing.But if you look at it carefully for a while, you will find that if you are a pedestrian running a red light, you must make sure that there is no vehicle, or the vehicle is far enough away from you, which will not affect the driver’s speed. When the pedestrian’s green light is on, although the vehicle can turn right, the driver must give priority to the pedestrian who takes the zebra crossing”, while “Chinese crossing” is unprincipled recklessness; She has also criticized the Chinese People’s Liberation（PLA） Army for blocking foreign journalists from filming a PLA base and asking the PLA to open a military exclusion zone to dispel US suspicions.But in his 2007 blog, Luqiu mentioned that when his colleagues stepped on the police cordon during interviews in the U.S. and were driven away by the police, Lvqiu luwei enthusiastically praised the American police for their ‘professional performance on duty.’</p>
<p>The last one is the discrimination between America born Chinese and origin chinese people. Most ABC are interested in Chinese culture and are actively learning Chinese. However, some hold extreme contempt for Chinese culture. And their parents or grandparents, although they are original Chinese, the views are different due to language barrier and culture shock. Victor Zheng, a 23-year-old Chinese American, decided to go to China to seek roots and develop his career, he had never thought that his Chinese identity would become a “disadvantage” in a country with black hair and yellow skin. “The company that originally planned to sign with me, but they eliminated me I had” a Chinese face, “Zheng wrote on his blog. This time, Zheng Kaicheng realized China’s “discrimination” against Chinese Americans.Among all kinds of foreigners who come to China for development, ABC is a special group. Their thinking is Americanized, but their appearance is no different from that of Chinese. Compared with foreigners of other ethnic groups, their development in China seems to face more misunderstanding and challenges.</p>
<p>In fact, when we think about it carefully, we use the word “discrimination” too serious. Every kind of prejudice has its objective reason. The differences in history, culture and ideas are irreversible, but we can also minimize the harm to people.distinguishing between “individual” and “population” is a kind of basic principle to treat people. A population gives people a negative impression, which does not mean that every “person” has such characteristics.</p>

<h1 id="Intro"><a href="#Intro" class="headerlink" title="Intro"></a>Intro</h1><p>四明湖位于宁波余姚梁弄镇旁，距我们大约81公里<br>走的G92杭州湾环线高速 大概开了一小时22分钟</p>
<blockquote>
<p>建议带的器材<br>相机 无人机 三脚架 各种滤镜 餐巾纸（有很多泥 会把鞋子弄脏）</p>

<p>因为两人都没吃早饭<br>所以全程紧盯着高速上的牌怕错过服务区</p>

<p>人非常多 车也非常多<br>我们停在了很远的马路边<br>走了大概十五分钟才到水杉景点</p>
